3. Security Assessment Report: Web Application Vulnerability Analysis

Overview of the Assessment:

This report highlights the security assessment of a web application, identifying critical vulnerabilities with recommended remediation.

Vulnerabilities Identified:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Found on the login page due to poor sanitization of user input.

SQL Injection: Present in user search functionality, thus allowing unauthorized access to the database.

Insecure Authentication: Poor password policies granted access through brute-force attacks.

Recommendations:

Implement input validation/input encoding in order to neutralize XSS.

Use parameterized queries and/or use ORM frameworks for reducing risk related to SQL injection.

Strict password policy - ensure MFA is enforced also.
