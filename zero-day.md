Zero-day vulnerabilities are among the most dangerous cybersecurity threats. Attackers use these flaws before vendors release patches, which results in data breaches, financial losses, and system compromises.

Recent Zero-Day Exploits:

Log4j - 2021: This vulnerability allowed remote code execution and affected enterprises around the world.

Follina - 2022: A Microsoft Office vulnerability that allows the execution of malicious scripts.

Mitigation Strategies

Deploy Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) tools to detect exploitation attempts.

Implement network segmentation to limit exposure.

Have a robust patch management strategy.

Conclusion:

Threat intelligence feeds must be constantly observed, and zero-day threats are to be thwarted by implementing security best practices by cybersecurity teams.
